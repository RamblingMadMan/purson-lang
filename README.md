# Purson
Functionally oriented general purpose programming language.

## Brief
Purson was created out of interest and curiosity rather than a need and as such 
features are added on a very loose schedule. All development is done in a 
rolling release fashion, releases are snapshots of development.

## Components

### Purson Library
This library contains functions for lexing, parsing and compiling Purson code as well as utilities to interface with programs written in purson.

### Purson REPL
A REPL environment for testing and prototyping. GNU Readline is used for 
autocompletion and history.

## Dependencies

A few dependencies are required to build/run the Purson components.

### Libraries

* GMP
* MPFR
* ICU
* Readline
